## Setting Up Keycloak with Docker


### Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have Docker installed on your system. Head over to the official Docker website to download and install it: [[https://www.docker.com/get-started/](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)]

### Steps

1. **Pull the Keycloak Docker Image:**

   ```bash
   docker pull jboss/keycloak:<version>  # Replace `<version>` with a specific version (e.g., 19.0.1) or leave blank for the latest
   ```

   This command pulls the Keycloak Docker image from the Docker Hub registry. You can optionally specify a specific version number for more control. Otherwise, the latest version will be downloaded.

2. **Run the Keycloak Container:**

   ```bash
   docker run -d --name keycloak -p 8080:8080 \
     -e KEYCLOAK_USER=your_username \
     -e KEYCLOAK_PASSWORD=your_password \
     jboss/keycloak
   ```

   Let's break down this command:

   - `-d`: Runs the container in detached mode, allowing it to operate in the background after startup.
   - `--name keycloak`: Assigns a friendly name (`keycloak`) to the container for easier identification and management.
   - `-p 8080:8080`: Maps the container's port 8080 (where Keycloak runs) to your host machine's port 8080. This allows you to access the Keycloak admin console at `http://localhost:8080/auth/admin`.
   - `-e KEYCLOAK_USER=your_username`: Sets the environment variable for the Keycloak admin username. Replace `your_username` with your desired username.
   - `-e KEYCLOAK_PASSWORD=your_password`: Sets the environment variable for the Keycloak admin password. Replace `your_password` with a strong password.
   - `jboss/keycloak`: Specifies the Docker image to use. You can find other available images on Docker Hub.

3. **Access the Keycloak Admin Console:**

   Once the container is running, open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080/auth/admin`. Use the credentials you specified in step 2 (username and password) to log in to the Keycloak admin console.

### Managing Keycloak Objects

Now that you're logged into the Keycloak admin console, you can start managing the core objects that define your authentication system:

**1. Realms:**

   - A realm represents a high-level authentication context, typically corresponding to a specific application or organization. Imagine a realm as a walled garden where users and applications interact under a defined set of access rules.
   - You can create multiple realms to segregate user bases and access controls. For example, you might have separate realms for your development, staging, and production environments.

**2. Clients:**

   - Clients represent the applications that will leverage Keycloak for user authentication (e.g., your web application or mobile app).
   - You'll need to register each client within Keycloak, providing details like:
     - **Client ID:** A unique identifier for your application within Keycloak.
     - **Valid Redirect URIs:** The authorized URLs where Keycloak should redirect users after successful authentication.
     - **Access Type:** Defines how your application will access tokens (confidential or public).
     - **Additional Configurations:** You can configure various security settings specific to your application's needs.

**3. Client Scopes:**

   - Client scopes define granular control over what information a client can access during token exchange.
   - Imagine you have a user profile with various attributes like name, email, and address. By creating client scopes, you can define which specific attributes each client application is authorized to access. This helps maintain data privacy and expose only the necessary information to each application.

**4. Roles:**

   - Roles define permissions or access levels within a realm. These roles act as access control gates within your application.
   - You can create roles such as "admin," "editor," or "user" and assign them to users or groups. By assigning roles to users, you control their access to specific functionalities within your application.

**5. Users:**

   - Users are the individuals who will authenticate with Keycloak.
   - You can create users, assign them to relevant realms, and grant them specific roles within those realms. This allows for fine-grained access control based on user identity. For instance, you might assign an "admin" role to specific users, granting
